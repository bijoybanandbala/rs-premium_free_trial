Name: PFT PHP Application Server for Chef Server (RightLink 10)
Description: "PHP Application Server for Chef Server (RightLink 10) ServerTemplate.
  \  RightLink10 is a new agent to connect servers to the RightScale platform that
  is very lightweight and simple to install.\r\n_It is not a plug-in upgrade from
  the older RightLink v6 series._\r\nSee [http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html)
  for details.\r\n\r\nIn addition to installing PHP, this ServerTemplate runs a script
  to update the packaging system and enable automatic security updates, and a collectd
  install script to enable RightScale monitoring. \r\n\r\nThe ServerTemplate can run
  on most any Linux distro that supports cloud-init. It is recommended to use the
  standard distro images in various clouds.\r\n\r\n__ Requirements__\r\n\r\n * Chef

  - Name: rs instance terminated
    Description: Raise an alert if the instance has been terminated abnormally, i.e.
      not through the RightScale interface or by an elasticity daemon resizing server
      arrays.
    Clause: If RS/server.state == terminated for 1 minutes Then escalate critical
  - Name: rs instance stranded
    Description: Raise an alert if the instance enters the stranded state.
    Clause: If RS/server-failure.state == stranded for 1 minutes Then escalate warning
  - Name: rs instance not responding
    Description: Raise an alert if the instance fails to send monitoring information
      for 5 minutes.
    Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value == NaN for 5 minutes Then escalate critical
  - Name: rs cpu busy
    Description: Raise an alert if the idle time is too low.
    Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value < 15 for 3 minutes Then escalate warning
  - Name: rs cpu overloaded
    Description: Raise an alert when the cpu idle time is too low.
    Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value < 3 for 5 minutes Then escalate critical
  - Name: rs cpu I/O wait
    Description: Raise an alert if disk io is too high.
    Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-wait.value > 40 for 15 minutes Then escalate warning
  - Name: rs low space in root partition
    Description: Raise an alert if the available space in the root partition is too low. This alert may be modified on

      cloned on an instance to match the actual network interfaces that are present. See the RL10 Linux Setup Alerts
      RightScript (rll/setup-alerts.sh) for more details.
    Clause: If interface-eth0/if_octets.tx > 10000000 for 10 minutes Then escalate critical
  - Name: rs high network rx activity
    Description: Raise an alert if the amount of network data received is too high. This alert may be modified or cloned
      on an instance to match the actual network interfaces that are present. See the RL10 Linux Setup Alerts

      not enabled. See the RL10 Linux Setup Alerts RightScript (rll/setup-alerts.sh) for more details.
    Clause: If swap/swap-free.value < 104857600 for 5 minutes Then escalate critical
