# Mappings of image name for each of the support clouds.
# A rudimentary regexp capability is supported to help narrow down the image to use.
# The assumption is that the given image name root is searched with leading and trailing anchors: /^STRING$/.
# However, you can add a trailing regexp, in square brackets [ ], to handle cases where the name changes over time.
# Note the need to escape any backslashes.
